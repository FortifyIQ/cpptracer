# CPPTracer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Galfurian/CPPTracer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Galfurian/CPPTracer)

The VariableTracer is a class which allows to generate vcd files from c++ variables.
It may be of use for tracing variables during the simulation of both discrete and continuous time models. The tracer itself is pretty simple to use.

Look at main.cpp for an example of usage.
